## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I wasn't sure how to turn the image from grayscale into colored. I started with an overlay but then wondered if a filter on the image would work. The filter idea was too complicated since the image was grayscale.

I tried to use grid but wasn't sure on how to add padding so resorted back to flexbox.

### Continued development

I want to learn how to use grid and also want to move on to full page layouts to see how components are integrated.
